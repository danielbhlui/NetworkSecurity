									<p>The last assignment of this course requires me to reflect upon
critically the events as well as my learnings during this course.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:
107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Module Reflection<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>A critical incident has happened: I got only
50% in my first assignment. So what? It shows that my learning approach is
wrong. Now what? I need a different behavior approach and think deeply about
what produces my learning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>After critical analysis, I have changed my
behavior to be more actively learning style by doing more active researches and
reading more. That has produced more learning for me. Throughout the rest of
the module, I have learned to identify and analyze various security threats and
vulnerabilities in network systems. I have been able to detect vulnerabilities
and assess the impacts on the system. I find that this module emphasized the
importance of a systematic approach to vulnerability assessment and that this
structured methodology ensures that potential threats are identified and
addressed effectively. As far as designing and critically appraising solutions
is concerned, by critically evaluating existing security measures and
identifying areas for improvement, I have been able to mitigate risks and
enhance overall security. As far as gathering and synthesizing information is
concerned, this module has taught me to utilize various resources, including
internet security alerts, warning sites, journal articles, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Secondly, this student does have evidence of
autonomous work, as well as evidence of working in collaboration with others.
When working independently, this student has produced the first assignment and
now the second assignment (the executive summary) and this very reflection
piece. When working with others, we have created discussion in collaborative
discussions one and two. In collaborative discussion two, this student has made
a peer response to Andrius¡¦ post, and he has responded back to me, thanking my
¡§thoughtful comments¡¨ and the additional perspectives that I have provided.
This student has also collaborated with Ming and Salem on the Seminar #6¡¦s
presentation on Generative AI. We did it on <span class=SpellE>Whatsapp</span>
while Salem is in a time zone several hours behind me and Ming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Thirdly, working on this module has been a
challenging yet enlightening experience. Throughout the course, I have often
felt hurried due to the sheer volume of tasks that needed to be completed. The
workload appeared to be quite heavy, and there was a constant need to conduct
more researches and complete additional work. This sense of urgency and
pressure significantly impacted my approach to the module.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The feeling of being hurried and overwhelmed
sometimes affected the quality of my work. For example, I only got a passing
grade on my first assignment. There were moments when I had to prioritize speed
over thoroughness, which occasionally led to less detailed outputs. However,
this pressure also pushed me to develop better time management skills and find
more efficient ways to handle the workload. Despite the challenges, I remained
committed to completing the module to the best of my ability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Throughout the module, I reviewed the views of
my peers and instructors, which provided valuable insights and different
perspectives on the topics covered. Engaging with others¡¦ viewpoints helped me
refine my understanding and approach to penetration testing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Yes, I have thought about what exactly produced
my learning during this module. Under ordinary circumstance, I agree that
studying on one hand and using/practicing the subject matters being studied on
the other hand would make a powerful combination that can let me understand
more and retain more on the subject matters. However, during these six weeks, I
am afraid the heavy work load has taken a toll on me. All I can do is to hurry
up and meet the deadlines. I just could not afford to slow down a little to smell
the roses along the pent test journey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>And yes, I do have evidence that I have
acquired a set of skills and knowledge that are crucial for identifying and
mitigating security vulnerabilities. I have become proficient in using tools
like Nmap to perform network scanning and enumeration. This involves
identifying active devices, open ports, and services running on a network.
Moreover, this module has provided hands-on experience with vulnerability
assessment tools such as Nessus and ZAP. I have learned to identify, classify,
and prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity. In a controlled
environment, I have tried out the exploitation of a vulnerable service in the
Altoro Mutual. This exercise highlighted the importance of having fortified
systems to prevent exploitation by malicious hackers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>This module has also taught me about anomalies.
I have learned to identify common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection,
cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). This student
finds it very interesting to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. This also
helps me to understand how to secure website and protect against potential
attacks in future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Last but not least, the module has also taught
me the ethical, social and legal aspects of hacking. I once again have been
reminded to follow GDPR in analyzing the legal side of things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In conclusion, the skills and knowledge
developed through this networking course have been instrumental in my ability
to conduct thorough and effective security assessments. By applying these
skills in future, I will help others identify and mitigate security risks,
thereby enhancing their security posture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
